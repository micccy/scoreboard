# Mictronic5677 scoreboard, a basic electronic scoreboard project

**Standard disclaimer:** _this is some project of mine that was created to tackle some very specific need and might not work as well elsewhere. However, it may still be useful to someone, so here it is._

**Description:** The mictronic5677 scoreboard project was born as a way to revive an old broken rusty electronic scoreboard chassis we found laying around. All of the control circuitry has been redone from scratch, it now implements an ATmega328P running at 4MHz and programmed in assembler to ensure exact timings. Every development choice has been taken as a direct response to precise needs, to ensure max reliability and most importantly to keep it cheap and made from easy to source components. A time signal radio receiver has been added to keep the time-of-day clock accurate 

**Status:** _Kinda functional (basic operation only)- incomplete documentation (no schematics available yet)_
